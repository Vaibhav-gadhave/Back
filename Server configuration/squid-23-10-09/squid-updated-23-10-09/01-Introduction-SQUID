                      Setting Up a Transparent  
                       HTTP [WebProxy] / FTP 
                            Caching 
                          Proxy server 
                          using SQUID 
=============================================================================
Is Squid installed ? Version ?    # rpm -q squid 
Install it !                      # rpm -ivh squid-2.5.STABLE1-5.i386.rpm

Squid is...  

  Offshoot of the Harvest Project
  a full-featured Web/FTP Proxy and Cache server
  designed to run on Unix systems  
  free, open-source software  
  the result of many contributions by unpaid (and paid) volunteers  

=============================================================================
With Squid you can...

   Use less bandwidth on your connection when surfing the Web
   Reduce latency [time taken to load a web page]
   Protect hosts on your intranet by proxying their web traffic
   Collect statistics about web traffic on your NW
   Prevent uses from visiting illegal sites
   Ensure that valid users only surf the net
   Enhance user's privacy by filtering sensitive info from web requests
   Reduce the load on your web servers
   Convert encrypted [HTTPS] requests on one side, to unencrypted [HTTP]
   requests on the other
   
=============================================================================
With Squid you CANNOT...

    Proxy email [SMTP], instant messaging, or IRC

=============================================================================
Squid supports...  

       proxying and caching of HTTP, FTP, and other   
       proxying for SSL encrypted traffic 
       cache hierarchies  
       ICP, HTCP, CARP, Cache Digests  
       transparent caching  
       WCCP (Squid v2.3 and above)  
       extensive sophisticated access controls  
       HTTP server acceleration aka surrogate mode  
       HTTP Interception Caching
       SNMP  
       caching of DNS lookups 
       URL redirection 
       traffic shaping
       numerous external auth modules
       advanced disk storage options

=============================================================================
H/W Requirements :

       Runs of all NIXes, Windoze etc
       FreeBSD is the best OSS for Squid 
       SCSI is better than ATA

       Bcos Squid uses a small amt of memory for every cached resource on the
       disk, there is a relationship between Disk Space and Memory which we
       will soon examine comprehensively

=============================================================================
Config File : /etc/squid/squid.conf
Testing     : squidclient* [formerly client*]
Cache Files : /var/spool/squid/
Log Files   : /var/log/squid/access.log  
              /var/log/squid/cache.log	       

=============================================================================
* Squid's job is both as a Proxy and Cache server [Webcache]
* It speaks many protocols, HTTP and FTP amongst them
* Squid has two faces - 
                       Client-side talks to browsers and user-agents.
		       The Client understands only HTTP and HTTPS [i.e. HTTP
		       encrypted with SSL/TLS.]
		       This means that you can't make a FTP Client talk to 
		       Squid unless the FTP Client is also a HTTP Client
		       And a Browser is BOTH anyway!

                       Server-side talks to HTTP,FTP servers which are also
		       called Origin Servers, since the data originates from
		       them
=============================================================================
                             SQUID Terminology 

What is Internet object caching?

   Internet object caching is a way to store requested Internet objects
   (i.e., data available via the HTTP, FTP, and gopher protocols) on a system
   closer to the requesting site than to the source. 
          Web browsers can then use the local Squid cache as a proxy HTTP 
   server, reducing access time as well as bandwidth consumption.

Web Caching      : Storing certain web resources [pages,data] for future use
   
Cache Hit        : Each time a HTTP request is satisfied by Squid from its cache
                   instead of accessing the Origin server
		 
Cache Hit Ratio/ : % of all requests satisfied as hits. Typically 30-60%
          Rate
	  
Byte Hit Ratio   : Volume of data [no of bytes] served from the cache
         Rate      

Cache Miss       : When Squid cannot satisfy a request from the cache and has
                   to access the origin server

		   This can happen for a no of reasons viz :
		   
		   * Obviously the first time a request is recd, it IS a cache
		     miss
		   * Squid may have purged the cached copy to make way for new
		     objects
		   * Resource is uncacheable eg credit card no on a web page
		   * Data may have a cacheable time limit set by the origin
		     server
		   
Cache Validation  : Process by which Squid ensures that stale data is never
                    served
