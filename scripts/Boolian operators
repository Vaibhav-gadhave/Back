Operator 	Description 	Example
! 	This is logical negation. This inverts a true condition into false and vice versa. 	                                    [ ! false ] is true.
-o 	This is logical OR. If one of the operands is true, then the condition becomes true.                                	[ $a -lt 20 -o $b -gt 100 ] is true.
-a 	This is logical AND. If both the operands are true, then the condition becomes true otherwise false.                 	[ $a -lt 20 -a $b -gt 100 ] is false.
