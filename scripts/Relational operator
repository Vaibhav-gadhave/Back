Relational Operators

Bourne Shell supports the following relational operators that are specific to numeric values. These operators do not work for string values unless their value is numeric.

For example, following operators will work to check a relation between 10 and 20 as well as in between "10" and "20" but not in between "ten" and "twenty".

Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20 then âˆ’

Operator 	Description 	Example
-eq  Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not; if yes, then the condition becomes true.                              	[ $a -eq $b ] is not true.
-ne  Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not; if values are not equal, then the condition becomes true. 	            [ $a -ne $b ] is true.
-gt  Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.     	[ $a -gt $b ] is not true.
-lt  Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.       	[ $a -lt $b ] is true.
-ge  Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand;
     if yes, then the condition becomes true. 	                                                                                    [ $a -ge $b ] is not true.
-le  Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand;
	 if yes, then the condition becomes true. 	                                                                                 	[ $a -le $b ] is true.

It is very important to understand that all the conditional expressions should be placed inside square braces with spaces around them. For example, [ $a <= $b ] is correct whereas, [$a <= $b] is incorrect.
