Arithmetic Operators

The following arithmetic operators are supported by Bourne Shell.

Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20 then âˆ’

Operator 	Description 	Example
+ (Addition) 	Adds values on either side of the operator                   	                                                `expr $a + $b` will give 30

- (Subtraction) 	Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand 	                                                    `expr $a - $b` will give -10

* (Multiplication) 	Multiplies values on either side of the operator                                                         	`expr $a \* $b` will give 200

/ (Division) 	Divides left hand operand by right hand operand	                                                                `expr $b / $a` will give 2

% (Modulus) 	Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder                                          	`expr $b % $a` will give 0

= (Assignment) 	Assigns right operand in left operand                                                                         	a = $b would assign value of b into a

== (Equality) 	Compares two numbers, if both are same then returns true. 	                                                    [ $a == $b ] would return false.

!= (Not Equality) 	Compares two numbers, if both are different then returns true.                                             	[ $a != $b ] would return true.

It is very important to understand that all the conditional expressions should be inside square braces with 
spaces around them, for example [ $a == $b ] is correct whereas,                                                                 [$a==$b] is incorrect.

All the arithmetical calculations are done using long integers.
