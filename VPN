Setup Your Own VPN Server Free Of Cost:
=======================================

Configure OpenVPN Server & Client in RHEL 8 (CentOS 8):

A Virtual Private Network is a technology solution used to provide privacy and security for inter-network connections. The most well-known case consists of people connecting to a remote server with traffic going through a public or insecure network (such as the Internet).

A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality,  security, and management of the private network. Encryption is a common, although not an inherent, part of a VPN connection.

History of VPN:
1996, and Microsoftâ€™s Gurdeep Singh-Pall has just invented PPTP (or Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol), a method for implementing virtual private networks. Singh-Pall did so to allow users to have a secure Internet connection and work effectively and securely from home. This is a milestone event that truly set 
the stage for the evolution of the VPN.

Server Configuration:
=====================
yum install -y epel-release
curl ifconfig.me
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Angristan/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh
yum install -y wget
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Angristan/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh
ls
chmod +x openvpn-install.sh
./openvpn-install.sh
systemctl start openvpn-server@server.service
systemctl start openvpn-server@server.service
ifconfig
route -n
ls -l
cp client.ovpn /tmp
----------------------

Client Configuration:
=====================
yum install openvpn -y
scp -r root@ip://root/client.ovpn .
curl ifconfig.me
openvpn --config client.ovpn
ifconfig
route -n
curl ifconfig.me
---------
Client Configuration: (Windows)
===========================
1. Verify your existing public IP address by opening http://whatismyip.org/ in your
browser.
2. On Windows, you will need to download the official OpenVPN Community
Edition binaries that come with a GUI.
3. Install the client software and execute it, then import the .ovpn file that you
created on the server & click on connect.
4. Now fire up a browser and open http://whatismyip.org/ and you should see the
IP of your OpenVPN server instead of the public IP provided by your ISP.
